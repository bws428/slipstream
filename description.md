‚ú± What is Slipstream?

Still entering your flight times manually? Those days are over. Slipstream allows you to export your completed flight pairings from CrewTrac and download them as a CSV (comma-separated values) file, which can then be imported into any digital logbook software such as LogTen Pro, Logbook Pro, ZuluLog, and others.

‚ú± How Does It Work?

1. Navigate to CrewTrac's "Pairing Inquire" page for any completed pairing.
2. Click the "Export" button to download that pairing as a CSV file.
3. Import the CSV file into your preferred digital logbook.
4. Grab a cocktail üç∏ and relax.
